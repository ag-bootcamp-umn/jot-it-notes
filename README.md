## Usage
From the Start Page, click the "Get Started" button to visit the notes page.
In the notes page, click on the input fields marked with the words "Note Title" and "Note Text". 

Once both fields contain text, a save icon will appear in the top-right corner. Click this to save your note. Titles of saved notes will appear in the left-hand column. To see the content of the note, click the title and the entire note will appear in the input area.

To add a new note, at any point, click the 'plus' icon, also located in the top-right corner of the app.

To delete a note at any time, click the trash icon next to the note title in the notes list on the left side of the page.
